# TeamBD5-Final-Project

## Project Description

## Technical Description
We will be reading this data via Twitter's API
**[Search Tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview)**
feature. We settled on just using the Standard _(free)_ of this search
API, that only allows a sample size of tweets from the past 7 weeks.
The type of data wrangling we're planning to do is **reshaping the data** to fit our search query.
We don't have any new packages to use for this library yet, we're planning to use the usual ones _(dplyr, ggplot2/plotly)_ until we deeply dive into this API to find **unfamiliar complexities that would require new libraries/packages.** The major challenges we anticipate to have are having **trouble data wrangling and implementing** that data to a Shiny application. Also, knowing how to **utilize the parameters and queries** provided by the API to do what we are planning to do.
